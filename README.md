# Scraping Email Address From Website https://welcome2poland.eu

### The program is used to retrieve email addresses from https://welcome2poland.eu after entering "Category" and "Location".

The program allows you to retrieve email addresses from the specified range of search pages. We can change the page range in line 62 of the code.

The number of proxy addresses we want to search can be changed in line 27 of the code.

Email addresses will not be retrieved from sites that have not provided their address!

### The proxy addresses were used from github:https://github.com/mertguvencli/http-proxy-list/blob/main/proxy-list/data.txt

Thanks!
